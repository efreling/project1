		<p>Until end of the sophomore year, I was majoring in business only because that was what majority of my
            friends majored in. However, when I saw my friend did a project for CSC210, the whole final product compelled my 
            interest.</p>

		I knew only a little bit of Java coming out of high school and decided to to improve the situation with an intro programming class. Especially interesting to me was the way complex programs have an exact way of fitting together, piece by piece. After another year, I decided to persue a minor and gained experience with versatile programs I may not have ever used otherwise.

		I had no prior programming experiences coming into college, but I wanted to try something new. I wanted to learn practical skills, and possibly go into video game designâ€”a field I've always had an interest in. My first computer science course was very difficult, as everything that was taught was brand new to me. Despite the difficulties, I pushed on!
