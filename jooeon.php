			<h3>Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						I had no prior programming experiences coming into college, but I wanted to try something new. I wanted to learn practical skills, and possibly go into video game designâ€”a field I've always had an interest in. My first computer science course was very difficult, as everything that was taught was brand new to me. Despite the difficulties, I pushed on!

			<h4>Classes in Computer Science:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>CSC 170 - Introduction to Web Development</li>
					<li>CSC 171 - Introduction to Computer Science</li>
					<li>CSC 172 - Data Structures & Algorithms</li>
					<li>CSC 173 - Computation & Formal Systems</li>
					<li>CSC 186 - Video Game Development</li>
					<li>CSC 273W: Writing For Computer Science</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Programming Languages:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>C</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Digital Media Studies</h3>
					<p>
						Digital Media Studies cover such a broad range of topics that interested me, including vidoe game development, graphic design, photography, visual art, and music. It was the perfect minor to explore a variety of media and also implement some of my technical skills in programming.
					</p>
			<h4>Classes in Digital Media:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>DMS 101 - Introduction to Digital Media Studies</li>
					<li>DMS 103 - Essential Digital Media Toolkit</li>
					<li>DMS 104 - Design in the Digital Age</li>

					<li>DMS 120 - Video Game Design</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Experience in:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
					<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
					<li>Unreal Engine</li>
					<li>Gamemaker Studio 2</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Clubs and Organization</h3>
				<p>I've been a part of the school's Rock Repertory Ensemble since my first semester of college. I am one of the guitarists for the band. Since coming to college, I've been able to develop my interest in music and playing the guitar through the band, and also through taking lessons at the Eastman School of Music.</p>

			<h2>High School Projects and Areas of Study</h2>
					<p>
						One of the subjects I enjoyed most in highschool was physics. Understanding the laws of nature and implementing matheatical formulas to describe the behavior of the universe and everything within it, was mind-boggling. One of the project I did in physics involved gyroscopes and their ability to produce a motion called gyroscopic precession. I conducted an experiment and wrote a paper on my findings.
