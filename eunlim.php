			<h2>At the University of Rochester</h2>
			<h3>Computer Science</h3>
			<p>
            Until end of the sophomore year, I was majoring in business only because that was what majority of my
            friends majored in. However, when I saw my friend did a project for CSC210, the whole final product compelled my 
            interest. I am a person who need to see visual and tangible result but studying business never could fulfill
            my desire. But I knew coding would give me explicit product and this is how I started to change my major 
            to Computer Science.

			<h2>High School Projects and Areas of Study</h2>
            <p>
            The most interesting subject I learned in highschool is chemistry. The fact that everything is composed of atoms was mind blowing. 
            Also, if you have enough knowledge about chemistry, it provides an excellent basis for understanding the physical universe we live in.
            In my class, we didn't do any project but labs which made me completey lose track of time.
